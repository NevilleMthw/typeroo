<p>The file for my game code is called game.js. The JavaScript file contains all the code related to my game and all the elements in it. My code contains the timeout function, scoreboard, the boss health bar function, the gameover screen, storing of the score and winner screen </p>
<strong>Objects and arrays used in JavaScript code:</strong>
<p>I have used objects and arrays for my game, this includes for my score, word list and my login details.</p>
<p>The screenshot below shows my code for saving the score to the local storage, in order to display the username and the respective score to the leaderboard. For this code to work, I have used an object and named it pointArray to store the username and the points.</p>

<br>
<p>The screenshot below shows the objects being stored in the local storage for displaying in the leaderboard.</p>

<br>
<p>For my sign up function I have used objects to store the username and password so that it can be transferred onto my sign in function.</p>

<br>
<p>This screenshot shows my wordlist which are the words to be typed in my game. I have used an array to store all my words.</p>
<img src = "../Report/Code screenshots/wordlist.JPG">
<br>
<p>The screenshot below is how I have used the typing(e) function in order to check the word typed in my game, once the word is typed, it will fade out and the next word will appear. The typed word will cut off a small part of the monster's health, the typing is also denoted by a red colour.
    The animation used is the fadeout, animated feature, typing of the words and reduction of the boss health. 
    <br>
    For my graphics, I have used a gif for when the monster is alive and when it dies after the user wins the game.

<p>The code below is about my signup and signin function. The signin function also shows an error message if the username field is undefined in the login form. Once the correct details are given, both the username and password is stored in the session storage from there the login details are inputted.
    The username and username entered in the sign up and login form are stored in JSON format in the local storage. </p>
