# ..Typeroo..
Game project created using HTML, CSS and JS.

This project was created for my university 2nd year module. The main highlight of the website is the game and how the leaderboard scores get stored into the storage.

My game is related to a typing speed test with three difficulty levels, a timer and the objective of how quick the user can kill the monster.

<b>This game was inspired from the original Typing Warrior game.</b>
